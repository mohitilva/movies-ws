# movies-ws
This application is for Android mobile devices. It uses webservice to get data about movies.
There is only one activity (at the time of repo creation) MainActivity. The fragments in that activity get replaced.
If you want to use this app, you will need to get your own API Key. 
For WebService details see WSMetaData.java under com.mohitilva.moviesfun.model
